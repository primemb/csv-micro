## Installation Steps

1. Install npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate users:

   ```bash
   npm run generate:users
   ```

3. Start the application with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will install all dependencies, generate the required user data, and start all services in detached mode using Docker Compose.
